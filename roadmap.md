# Roadmap

- [x] BJ-0090 — Jobs list shows full assigned team (Lead + Assistants) on desktop table and mobile card; role labels only when assists exist; single batched `job_engineers` lookup; unit tests for grouping/labels.
- [x] Bug: Possible Duplicate badge missing on Schedule page — `Schedule.tsx` now carries `possible_duplicate` into `ScheduleJob`; badge rendered on weekly grid (desktop + mobile) and Unallocated Jobs cards. Detection logic untouched.
